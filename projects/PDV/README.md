There is a project that takes a protein list as an input. Output is a tree showing the network of interactions between proteins.

### Development:

<ol type="1">
  <li>Generate the html file as an output.</li>
  <li>Add chord diagrams.</li>
  <li>Enter parameters from the console level.</li>
  <li>Create a table/tables with protein statistics, for example percentage content of hydrophobic amino acids in proteins.</li>
  <li>Download protein descriptions from database and show user if he wants it.</li>
  <li>User can choose from the console level what should be in the output html file (tree / chord diagram / table / description).</li>
